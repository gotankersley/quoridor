tqbn =  wall_centers + turn + pawn1 + walls1.zfill(2) + pawn2 + walls2.zfill(2) + (pawn3 + walls3.zfill(2) + pawn4 + walls4.zfill(2))

TQBN v. 3
- For debugging, show which player placed wall with uppercase characters being PLAYER1, and lowercase for PLAYER2

Variants consider:
- RLE compression
- Only listing 20 wall positions, (B64 encoded)
- Using the hex representation of VWALL / HWALL bitboard
