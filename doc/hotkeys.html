<h2>Hotkeys:</h2>
<pre>
WASD / Arrow keys to move pawn (Note, for diagonal jumps you still need to use the mouse)
Click to place a wall


Holding down the CTRL key let's you override the rules, for example:
- Unlimited pawn moves =  CTRL+WASD
- Unlimited wall places = CTRL+click to place wall.  NOTE - I can not be responsible for anything that happens if you place more than 10 walls per player
- Remove wall = CTRL+click on wall
- Change the turn = CTRL + 1 for player 1, and CTRL + 2 for player 2
- Ctrl + z = undo move
- Ctrl + y = redo move
